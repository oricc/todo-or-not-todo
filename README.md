# TODO or not TODO
This exercise is meant to teach a new team member all the neccecary technologies in the team.
In my case this means the following:

1. Languges
- C#
- Python

2. Storage
- Oracle
- Redis
- Elasticsearch

3. Messaging
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka


The exercise is designed in such a way so the each stage must be completed (including DR and CR by team members), before procceding to the next stage.
